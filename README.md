# Suicide Detection using Text Mining and Machine Learning

## Overview

Suicide is a major public health concern, and early identification of individuals at risk of suicidal behavior is crucial for preventing suicide. However, identifying such individuals can be challenging due to the complexity of suicidal behavior. In recent years, text mining techniques and machine learning have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing text data to detect patterns indicative of suicidal behavior.

This project aims to develop a high-precision model for identifying text data that may indicate suicidal behavior using text mining techniques and machine learning. The dataset used for this purpose is collected from the social media platform Reddit, providing a rich source of text data that offers insights into the language of individuals who might be at risk.

## Models and Techniques

To achieve this goal, a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques were employed, including:

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forests
- Neural Networks
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes

These models were trained on the Reddit dataset to detect language patterns associated with suicidal behavior. The best accuracy achieved for each model with TF-IDF vectorization is as follows:

- Linear Regression: 92.5%
- Logistic Regression: 93.6%
- SVM: 93.5%
- Random Forest: 85.9%
- Naive Bayes: 90.8%
- Neural Networks: 93.1%

## Model Performance

The developed model achieved remarkable accuracy in identifying texts that may indicate suicidal behavior. This project demonstrates the potential of text mining and machine learning in early identification and intervention for individuals at risk of suicide.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a foundation for further research in the field of suicide prevention and public health. By leveraging text mining and machine learning, it offers solutions for improving public health outcomes by enabling the early identification and intervention of individuals at risk of suicidal behavior.
